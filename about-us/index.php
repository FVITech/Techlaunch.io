                    <p>In the rapidly growing tech industry, finding the right training is key. At TechLaunch @ Florida Vocational Institute (FVI), we’re committed to preparing our students for a career in technology in less than a year. In this time, we prepare our students to fill the void by providing the training they need. In our programs, we transform general computer users into technologists and empower people to get a rewarding career within one year.</p>

                    <p>The world of tech presents many challenges and it can be difficult to keep up with this constantly changing industry. That’s why we continually refine our curriculum based on feedback from our hiring partners – companies who use technology everyday and can identify skill gaps within the industry. This puts our grads on the right path and provides them with hard to find skills that employers are looking for.</p>

                    <p>Along with helping grads obtain new career opportunities, we’re also committed to helping our community. With programs like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Bridging-the-Economic-Tech-Gap-Free-Coding-Camp-For-Low-Income-Kids-430438653.html">TechHire.Miami and Summer Bootcamps</a>, our goal is to build local awareness of the growing tech industry, giving high school students the chance to learn new skills that can propel their career. By exposing these students to the tech industry at a young age, we can create a spark of interest and show them the world of opportunities being created as more companies are adopting technology into their daily operations.</p>
