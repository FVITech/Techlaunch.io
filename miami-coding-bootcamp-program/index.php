                    <p>If you’re new to the world of coding and web development, it can seem like an endless list of possibilities. The industry needs more trained professionals, and you don’t need a four-year degree. You don’t have to worry about the extensive curriculums involved in a traditional college program. </p>
<p>
If you’ve never coded before, you can streamline the process with specialized immersive coding classes. Students who are already working in the industry can push their careers forward with formalized training. Sometimes, more advanced concepts aren’t quite as easy to learn on your own. Tech Launch also helps students who want to learn specific coding languages every day.

                    <p>One of the biggest challenges for many students is knowing how to move forward. When you learn how to code, you can find sites pointing you in various directions. Self-directed learning can be great for some students, however there is little or no one on one training and completion rates tend to suffer. Tech Launch offers students classes designed around you. We offer small class sizes, more immersive coding education and financial aid is available for those who qualify.   
</p>
<p>
Classes can be handled at your own pace. You can also count on support from instructors who work to help students succeed every day. You should always set aside certain times for class-related work.   
</p>
<p>
Coding bootcamps are designed to be more intensive and professionals use them at all levels. You can also find tech skills upgrade classes that add additional knowledge and skill making you even more valuable.

                    <p>Once you complete coding school courses, you can start applying for new jobs. You can also talk to your current employer about more opportunities based on your expanded skill set. Some of our students aren’t interested in working for someone else at all. Instead, they open a business or go freelance. Some people opening a small business also enroll in our coding programs to understand different parts of their business. No matter what kind of business you run, the internet plays an increasingly important role. You can hire coders to build and maintain your website. When you understand coding, you can set more realistic expectations.</p>

                    <p>If you’re serious about a career in the tech industry, a coding bootcamp could be a major step in the right direction. The internet is constantly changing, and professionals must be dynamic to keep up. If you’re serious about a new career, formal training can separate those who succeed and coders who lag behind. 
                    </p>
<p>
You can find plenty of free resources readily available online. These resources aren’t always up to date. If you want to build a future, you need the right information. Others might not cover the most important languages or other things developers are expected to know. One on one instruction is missing from these types of programs so less people tend finish the programs.  At Tech Launch we work with you every steps of the way.  Questions are answered and problems avoided.  When looking for employment, employers don’t look at your intentions. They consider what you bring to the table. This often centers around portfolios and samples. What kind of past work can you show them? When you graduate from FVI School of Technology, you leave with a portfolio of work that employers want to see.   
</p>
<p>
Tech Launch streamlines the process to help students learn more of what they need to know. Instead of spending thousands of dollars on a four-year degree, you can get straight to the core knowledge you need. We help students pursue their dreams and find more answers. Just check out our coding bootcamps and see what Tech Launch can offer you.
