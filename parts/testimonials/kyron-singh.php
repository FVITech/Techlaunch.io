        <p class="quote">This school is awesome! The teachers are amazing. They actually want to teach you. The teachers here actually care. I was trying to go back to school for a while and didn't know what I was wanted to do and I came here. How they structure the classes is pretty nice. You get the certificates here that you need to boost your self up in a career. I've got to get to more certifications one security plus and another one.  I'm still contemplating a career, help desk to start off and then on to something else like junior network administrator. These certifications work for hospitals, police stations and big corporations. You've got Comcast, hotels, condominiums, you name it. if you're going do it, stick to it.  Don't let a failure stop you from achieving what you can in the future. </p>
