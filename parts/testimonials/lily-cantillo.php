        <p class="quote">"Hello, my name is Lilianne Cantillo, I am from Cuba. Since I moved to United States I have been working in the hospitality business, but this has never been my passion. My passion is in computers, and one day I will become software developer. I did some research and I found TechLaunch. I decided to enroll in the school and since I started there, I have had an amazing experience.  One of the things I love about the school is that classes are small, and anytime that I have a question, the instructors are there to help me. Before I started at TechLaunch I was concerned. I thought that coding was difficult and I didnâ€™t know what to expect. Now I feel that it is easier than everybody thinks. You need to put a little bit of effort and time; but if I can do it, you can do it too. So far it has been a great experience and I am looking forward to finally finding my dream job as a web developer."</p>
