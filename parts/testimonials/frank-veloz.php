        <p class="quote">"I graduated from TechLaunch six months ago, now I am working as a web developer at Tango Mango. TechLaunch has changed my life. I was working as a packer when I decided to go to school. After I graduated, I got 3 job offers. When I told my boss that I was leaving to work as a web developer, he didn’t want me to leave. I received a raise, they improved my position, and I created the IT department. When I started at TechLaunch a year ago, I didn’t know anything about coding. The professors gave me a lot of support. They are always there for you, and you can always count on them. The things you will learn at Techlaunch are going to change your life. If you have dedication, you can learn coding and the necessary tools to create and improve your skills. My advice to someone who is interested in learning to code, or likes technology is to visit TechLaunch and the programs they offer. The sooner you start learning how to code, the better future you are going to have."</p>
