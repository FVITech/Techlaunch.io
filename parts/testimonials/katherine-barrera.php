        <p class="quote">"Before my journey with FVI School of Technology I was in the logistics industry.  I was an ocean import and export coordinator.  It was a lot of paperwork, a regular office job. I chose to enroll because they focus on the certifications.  It's a great opportunity to graduate knowing that I'll have an extensive background.  My experience with FVI School of Technology has been great.  I've been learning about routers and switches, doing spanning tree calls. This is a very high demand industry that keep on Growing.  My favorite thing about FVI School of Technology is the hands-on lab.  I get to play with routers and switches.  I get to connect them, I get to work with the command-prompt. We are now learning about hacking.  Tech is an industry where you keep learning every day and it's a great career because its very high demand and the pay is great in the end. I would definitely recommend FVI School of Technology if you love learning new things and everything that has to do with computers, technology, programming, code, whatever it is, this is the place for you especially women.
