        <p class="quote">My name is Peter Luis. I have a Haitian background. Before Tech Launch, I was really just job hopping from place to place. I was always interested in computers and then my friend recommended this school to me and ever since, it's been the best decision I've ever made. The experience shere that I've had has been pheno menal from the instructors to the faculty everyone being so friendly. The hands-on that we do is not cookie cutter and  every moment is worth it. Career Services helped a lot. My resume was awful. Vanessa in Career Services is just top-notch she recommends tips you should do during the interview. Questions you should ask employers and how you should dress.I would say to stay motivated, focused and driven because everyone here is willing to help, you just have to ask.</p>
