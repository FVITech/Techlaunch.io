        <p class="quote">"I have so much to thank the school and their teachers for, because thanks to them I've graduated as a Web Developer and increased my knowledge greatly. I thought that becoming a programmer was something that was unachievable for me, but thanks to Victor Moreno, Rady Ferrer and Jose, I was able to do so easily. This is why I invite you to join me in turning your dreams into reality at TechLaunch. Thank you TechLaunch for everything, I am so thankful."</p>
