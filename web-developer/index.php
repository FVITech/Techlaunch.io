                    <h4>Coding Bootcamps</h4>
                    <p>The South Florida region offers a handful of coding bootcamps. These programs are often effective, but they take place during the work day and do not offer financial aid. The technology programs at Techlaunch take place during the evenings and therefore don't interfere with the 9-5 career schedule and financial aid can cover the majority of tuition costs.</p>
                    <p>Most importantly, the coding bootcamps are 320 total hours while Techlaunch's program is 720 total hours. We think 320 hours is barely enough time to become a web developer, let alone a strong one. There are no shortcuts--you will become a strong web developer by the end of our program.</p>

                    <h4>Computer Science Degrees</h4>
                    <p>A computer science degree will give you an excellent understanding of computers and the internet, but it won't give you any coding skills to apply your knowledge. You won't have a portoflio of projects proving you can make stuff.</p>
                    <p>A developer's portfolio is the most important part of their resume.</p>
                    <p>By the end of Techlaunch's Web Developer program, you will have a rich portfolio full of varied, in-depth, relevant projects.</p>

                    <h4>Online Programs</h4>
                    <p>There are a few different online coding schools and websites that can take a beginner from amateur to intermediate however, online programs are notorious for low completion rates.</p>
                    <p>As a student in Techlaunch's Web Developer program, you will be learning and coding with a professional web developer in the same room who can immediately answer any questions, look at your code, and offer you feedback and encouragement. Such a close student-mentor relationship cannot be found in online programs.</p>
