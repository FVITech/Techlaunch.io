                    <p>In the rapidly growing tech industry, finding the right training is key. At FVI School of Technology, we’re committed to preparing our students for a career in technology in less than a year. In this time, we prepare our students to fill the void by providing the training they need. In our programs, we transform general computer users into technologists and empower people to get a rewarding career within one year.</p>
                    <p>Every time a new technology comes out, people find a way to disrupt it. Hacking has become one of the most problematic parts of business. Many large companies also embrace it. They hold hacking conferences and competitions to see who can breach their systems and how they do it. Even a small vulnerability in our technical systems can put sensitive data at risk. This creates a need for more trained cyber security professionals.</p>
                    <p>What is cyber security and how does it help? Experts estimate almost <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/05/28/companies-unprepared-as-hacking-increases">50% of adults in the US have been the victims of cyberattacks</a> in the past year alone. That number is only growing even in the federal government. With increased vigilance, we can catch vulnerabilities before they become serious problems. This is the role of a cyber security professional. You have to be on your toes to detect and fight digital crime.</p>
                    <p>What do cyber security programs teach you? An example of typical coursework includes classes like:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Cybercrime investigations  </li>
                      <li>Advanced Networking Concepts</li>
                      <li>Cloud Technology</li>
                      <li>Cisco Routing and Switching</li>
                    </ol>

                  <h2 class="section-title">Find the Core Courses You Need with Cyber Security Training in Miami</h2>
                    <p>Some students know they want to be in cyber security from a young age. Others need more time to figure out what they want to do, and they make a career change later on. Your core course load includes classes on things like ethics, cybercrime law, and information security. Advanced mathematics teach students what they need to know. So you&rsquo;ll also need classes in calculus, statistics, and more along with courses on the fundamentals of information technology. Many of today&rsquo;s experts also take classes in criminal investigations and criminal evidence. This way, you know how to track down cybercriminals.</p>
